Emulica is an emulation framework that enable researchers or practitionners 
to design and run emulation-based control experiments, in the context of 
manufacturing and logistics systems.

Emulica offers a small set of systemic-inspired generic constructs, that 
enable the modelling of complex system. Because of the emulation approach 
(i.e. only the physical system is represented, control functions are separated), 
the modelling is simple and efficient.

You can connect your emulated shopfloor to external systems by exenging XML 
messages over TCP socket, or you can write control processes embebed in the 
simulation engine in python. Simulation runs can be made in discrete event 
time advance or in real-time.

In addition to the core emulation fonctions, which can be embeded in any 
custom application, emulica ships a graphical (gnome) application. with 
visualisation and animation of the emulation model, comprehensive code 
editing of the control processes, including syntax highlight and with 
automated code generation, and results generation, including gantt charts 
for products and resources, holder occupation, etc...
