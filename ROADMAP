milestone 6 (version 0.6):
    * break gsemeapp into 4 parts : main, modelling, execution and results : OK
    * generalized properties support: OK
    * transition to xmlbuilder: OK
    * use 'format' instead of %: OK
    * Failure: degradated mode: OK
    * windows port/installer: OK
    * integration of Failure module in gsemeapp: OK
    * model/submodel interface: OK
    * DTD for emulation models and for reports and requests: OK
    * modelling tutorial: on-going
    * rename as 'emulica': OK
    
=================alpha=================

milestone 5 (version 0.5):
    * handle simulation errors in gseme : get errors and display message: OK
    * better status bar management : display useful messages, progress bar for simulation runs : OK
    * control editor preferences... OK
    * composite modeling (ability to include models in models, as modules): OK...
    * undo/redo for the whole application (ie control buffer + emulation model) : OK for create & delete, todo for some module properties...
    * graphical properties in model (move all selected modules, zoom): OK... some bug to fixe in selection handling...
    * fixe figure sizes, add colormap in preference: OK
    * result export: OK
    * web site: OK
    
milestone 4 (version 0.4):
    * multiple simulation run : OK
    * code snipets in control : OK
    * new result plots : queue utilisation and product life-cycle diagram: OK
    * selection/configuration of results: OK
    * usability of control panel (sourceview settings, highlight syntax error, include a compile button somewhere): OK
    * cup/copy/paste and undo/redo in the control tab: OK
    * make cup copy paste depend on context (control buffer, emulation model): OK
    * modelling tutorial: on-going...
    
milestone 3 (version 0.3):
    * better MVC architecture for module state changes and properties changes : OK
    * locale management in setup.py : OK
    * physical properties of products : OK
    * debian package : OK
    * preference window : OK
    * cup/copy/paste in emulation : OK

    * multiple selection (CTRL key): OK
    * module contextual menu: OK
    * warn user when closing a model : OK
    * pydoc/docbook generation integration in setup.py: OK
    * modelling tutorial : on-going
    
milestone 2 (version 0.2):
    * import/export of emulation models & control system : ok
    * graphical model construction : ok
    * simple simulation menu (start, stop, pause): ok
    * module properties panel: ok
    * assembly/ disassembly implementation and test:
    * test : garrett use case:
    * emulation serveur : ok
    * first results integration (gantt chart integration) : ok
    * delete in emulation: ok (even if, there is still some minors bugs)
