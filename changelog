0.6:


    * modularisation of gsemeapp (main, modelling, control, results, dialogs)
    * generalized properties support: OK (infrastructure done, UI todo)
    * transition to xmlbuilder
    * preparation of the transition to python 3
    * degrading failures

======================================
0.5:


  * handle simulation errors in gseme : get errors and display message
  * better status bar management : display useful messages, progress bar for simulation runs
  * control editor preferences...
  * composite modeling (ability to include models in models, as modules)
  * undo/redo for the whole application (ie control buffer + emulation model)
  * graphical properties in model (move all selected modules, zoom)
  * able to export results
  * basic module properties support

======================================
0.4:
In this version, we tried to make seme and its user interface gseme easier to
use. One the one hand, major change in the emulation package allow now to run 
simulation several times. On the other hand, our effort have been focused on 
control writing and results displaying in gseme. The control editor now include
a library of configurable code snippets and a syntax checking function that 
allow intuitive control design. Results have been improved too. Three new type 
of result (holder occupation, product life-cycle and a new generic result form)
have been added. Result selection have been developped.

This version is still alpha, but the beta is near... Next version will 
implements hirarchical (composite) modelling, undo/redo in the emulation tab, 
result export and printing, and a better handling of runtime control errors...

  * ability to run simulation several times.
  * new result type : Holder occupation graph, Product life-cycle chart, result summary
  * helper in the control tab: insertion of code, syntax checking, etc...
  * selection/configuration of results
  * new function in the control tab : syntax checking, code snippets, etc...
  * Cut/copy/paste and undo/redo in the control editor
  * several UI / usability improvements

=======================================
0.3:
We are glad to announce a new version of seme and gseme, its graphical interface. 
It the emulation library, it is now possible to model physical attributes of 
products... In the modelling application, many improvements have been made.

The software is still alpha-quality, but great progress have been made. The next
release will focus on usability/ergonomy in writing control system, add on 
results configuration.


  * new properties architecture for emulation.module objects: better module
    management in gui, better properties display.
  * improved application icon and several module icons
  * Refactored UI for programs: transformation attribute are now displayed in a
    separate dialog window. Change of Products Physical properties are supported.
  * Integrated physical properties of products
  * New preference dialog
  * Cut/Copy/Paste of emulation modules
  * GUI code for editing modules properties has been separated in a new package
    'seme.properties'
  * several other GUI improvements
  
=======================================
0.2:
 * emulation server (listen for Requests, and send Reports on a TCP port)
 * internationnalisation
 * UI improvements:
    filters on file dialogs
    new buttons : pause simulation, stop simulation, ...
    better application icon
    import/export of emulation models & control system
    module selection
    module deletion
 * improvements in module properties:
    modules are completelly editables (incl. setup, programs, etc...)
    modules can be renamed
 * module 'config' is now named 'semeXML'
    parsing and writing Report and Request XML messages
 * emulation
    assembly
    improved test-cases
    

=======================================
0.1: Initial release
